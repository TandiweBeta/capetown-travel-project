    <h2>Why Capetown</h2>
    <h3>Capetown, the mother city</h3>
    <p>
     The southernmost tip of Africa is one of the most magnificent parts of the world, a paradise full of exquisite scenery, beautiful beaches, two oceans – the icy Atlantic and the warmer Indian Ocean – and a wide variety of attractions to make any holiday-maker happy.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where Cape Town is located. They call it ‘the Fairest Cape’, and there’s a reason for this. It really is a magical city, with flat-topped Table Mountain looming over it. It stretches around the mountain, and wherever you are, there are often glimpses of sea and golden beaches, not to mention that iconic mountain as its beautiful backdrop.
