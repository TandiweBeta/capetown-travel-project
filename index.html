    <h2>Why Capetown</h2>
    <h3>Capetown, the mother city</h3>
    <p>
     The southernmost tip of Africa is one of the most magnificent parts of the world, a paradise full of exquisite scenery, beautiful beaches, two oceans – the icy Atlantic and the warmer Indian Ocean – and a wide variety of attractions to make any holiday-maker happy.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where Cape Town is located. They call it ‘the Fairest Cape’, and there’s a reason for this. It really is a magical city, with flat-topped Table Mountain looming over it. It stretches around the mountain, and wherever you are, there are often glimpses of sea and golden beaches, not to mention that iconic mountain as its beautiful backdrop.

          <h4>Boulders Beach</h4>
          <p>
            Boulders Beach is a sheltered beach made up of inlets between granite boulders, from which the name originated. It is located on the Cape Peninsula, in Simon's Town in the Western Cape province of South Africa.It is a popular tourist spot because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. 
            </p>
            <h5>Address</h5>
            <p> Simon's Town, Cape Town, South Africa 7995</p>
            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>
              The beauty of this small hidden attraction is next to none. The ancient granite boulders protect it from the wind and large waves,making it an ideal swimming spot for children. The beach is always clean and safe, and it is rarely crowded. You also get to know our most famous and arguably our cutest birds, The African penguin.
